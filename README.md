# dimorphicERV

DimorphicERV is the integrated name of two pipelines called findprovirus and findsoloLTR. 
These pipelines are used to identify proviral deletions resulting from LTR recombination events
from whole genome resequencing paired-end data aligned to the reference genome. 

Step 1: Generation of the catalogue of solo LTR or proviral copies of the HERV family.

To generate the catalogue of solo LTR and proviral elements of a particular family the tool
One Code to Find them All (Bailly-Bechet et al. 2014) is used. The script called ""The output from that tool was
